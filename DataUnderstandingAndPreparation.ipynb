You will beging preparing your data so that it can be used to train a machine learning model that solves a regression problem. Note that by the end of the lab, your data set won't be completely ready for the modeling phase, but you will gain experience using some common data preparation techniques. \n",

Some features that contain text data are categorical. Others are not. For example, we removed all of the features that contained URLs. These features were not categorical, but rather contained what is called unstructured text. However, not all features that contain unstructured text should be removed, as they can contain useful information for our machine learning problem. Unstructured text data is usually handled by Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. You will learn more about NLP later in this course. \n",

    "some unstructured text features could be the host location, neighborhood, amenities, since these things could also all impact the price of an airbnb. For example, we can do host location (assuming this means the location of the airbnb). Certain states or cities may have higher rates othan others. If we can group the airbnbs close by to each other, we can gain a more acurate prediction of price if we are predicting the price of a new house in a certain area. For example, we would predict an apartment in the middle of NYC to be much higher than an apartment in the middle of no-where in a rural town. "
